**PROJECT TITLE**

Comprehensive Diabetes Dataset with Genetic, Environmental, and Lifestyle Factors

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Diabetes mellitus includes multiple subtypes, each with distinct causes and progression patterns. Understanding how genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors interact is essential for personalized healthcare. This project analyses a comprehensive dataset covering Steroid-Induced Diabetes, Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), Prediabetes, Type 1 Diabetes, and Wolfram Syndrome to identify unique and shared risk factors. The challenge is to determine which factor combinations contribute to each subtype, enabling better diagnosis, targeted interventions, and effective disease management.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project uses a comprehensive dataset encompassing multiple diabetes subtypes, including Steroid‑Induced Diabetes, Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), Prediabetes, Type 1 Diabetes, and Wolfram Syndrome. The dataset includes medical, genetic, environmental, and lifestyle attributes to provide a holistic view of each patient’s profile. The aim is to help researchers and healthcare professionals understand how these factors interact and contribute to the development and progression of different diabetes subtypes, enabling insights for personalized treatment, risk assessment, and improved disease management.

**Goals**

**1.Risk Prediction:**

Predict likelihood of developing specific diabetes subtypes using genetic, environmental, lifestyle, and medical data

**2.Feature Analysis & Interpretation:**

Identify key factors and their interactions influencing each subtype.

**3.Subtype Classification:**

Build a model to distinguish among the different diabetes types using available data (e.g. classify a new patient into Type 1 vs NDM vs Steroid‑Induced, etc.).

**4.Public Health Insights:**

Inform preventive strategies to reduce risk, especially in genetically susceptible populations.


**Domain:**

Healthcare Analytics / Machine Learning for Disease Prediction

**Objective:**

1.Predictive Modelling: Develop a model to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, supporting early intervention and personalized healthcare.

2.Classification: Classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.

**Sample Output**

**Predicted Diabetes Subtype Probabilities**

**Diabetes Subtype	Probability**
Prediabetes	0.65
Type 1 Diabetes	0.15
Steroid-Induced Diabetes	0.05
Wolfram Syndrome	0.02
NDM (Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus)	0.13
Predicted Subtype: Prediabetes

**Interpretation**
	**Genetic Factors:** Presence of Genetic_Marker_1 significantly increases Prediabetes risk.

**Lifestyle & Clinical Factors:** High BMI and moderate diet score further elevate risk.

	**Model Insight:** Effectively captures complex interactions between genetic, clinical, and lifestyle variables, which may be missed by linear models.

**Sample Final Decision**

Chosen Model

•	**Reason for Selection:** High accuracy, interpretability, and strong performance in multiclass diabetes subtype prediction.

•	**Final Prediction:** Wolcott-Rallison Syndrome (55.95%)

•	Although Prediabetes had the highest single-class probability (0.65), the final prediction incorporates overall model confidence, clinical relevance, and ensemble decision logic to ensure a data-driven and clinically meaningful outcome.
